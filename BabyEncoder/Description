A Python script for interacting with a remote server using the pwntools library.

Connecting to a Remote Server:
The code establishes a connection to a server at the address '202.120.7.212' on port 20001 using the remote function from the pwntools library.

Initial Server Communication:
It receives and parses some data from the server. It reads values for v and m from the server's response after specific prompts.

Calculations and Sending a Response:
The code computes res using the values received: res = pow(2, 2 ** v, m). This is a modular exponentiation operation.
It then sends the computed result back to the server as an answer.

Receiving Data in Blocks:
The code enters a loop to receive a large block of data in chunks of 0x2000 bytes from the server.
    * It gathers the received bytes and interprets them as double-precision floating-point values (<d) using struct.unpack.
    * These values are then processed in blocks of 128 using NumPy's FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) inverse function (np.fft.ifft).
    * The absolute values of certain elements from the inverse FFT results are calculated and rounded.
    * These processed values are appended to a list (ans) and then converted to bytes.

Sending the Processed Data:
Once the data processing is complete, it waits for a specific prompt from the server and sends the computed ans back to the server.

Interactive Mode:
The script then enters interactive mode, allowing for manual interaction with the server if needed.

This script is likely part of a challenge where the server sends mathematical values, expects certain computations as a response, and then processes and sends back specific data based on the received information. It appears to involve modular exponentiation, FFT, and handling data in a particular format as requested by the server.
